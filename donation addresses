Donations are not expected but are welcome. Donations go to funding operations as laid out in my mission satement.

So far donations have been used to help fund the hardware for Node2.0 and most of the hardware needed for a second node of the same setup. This has also funded a backup drive for fireproof and EMP proof blockchain backup. And a spare RAID drive for each of the two nodes, a security camera, secure network equipment to help guard the nodes from physical and cyber threats. 

Estimate of $100 would cover remaining cost to complete hardware setup for the second Node. For the second Nodes UPS and some wiring. If there are no donations I still plan to improve and grow operations as much as I can with paying for expenses if any myself.
